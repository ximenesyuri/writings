Here you will find my published books.

1. [Topologia, Geometria e Buracos Negros](./topology_geometry_black_holes.pdf)
    - NEA, 2016, 264 pages
    - ISBN-10: 9783841718242
    - ISBN-13: 978-3841718242
    - The book has three parts. The first presents Algebraic Topology in a categorical perspective. The second one introduces modern differential geometry in terms of principal bundles, $G$-structures and their invariants. Finally, the third part uses all the constructed machinery to develop the general theory of black holes.
2. [Introdução à Teoria da Homotopia Abstrata](./abstract_homotopy_theory.pdf)
    - NEA, 2018, 216 pages
    - ISBN-10: 6202182202
    - ISBN-13: 978-6202182201
    - An introduction to Abstract Homotopy Theory by means of $(\infty,1)$-categories presented by categories with weak equivalences and model categories. The main objective is to show that Classical Homotopy Theory can be described in a more elegant and universal way.
3. [Introdução à Mecânica Racional](./rational_mechanics.pdf)
    - NEA, 2021, 56 pages
    - ISBN-10: 6202808330
    - ISBN-13: 978-6202808330
    - An introduction to the formal approach to Newtonian Mechanics in the spirit of the so-called Rational Mechanics.
